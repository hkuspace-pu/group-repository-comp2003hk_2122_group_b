    'This is an evergreen tree of the Mimosaceae family.  Leaves are double compound, with glands.  Pale white flowers occur in clusters at the end of branches.  Numerous long white stamens make it look like a powder-puff flower.  It favors higher temperatures and humidity, while not being too choosy for soil conditions.  It grows best nonetheless in well-drained red and sandy soil.  It also prefers sunshine to shade, and sheltered to wind-exposed area.  Capable of rapid growth, it has dense leaves and branches, providing good shade.  The wood is brown in color, soft in texture; bark contains tannin.  Three native Albizia Chinensis exist near the Academic Building.  They are older than the University itself.'

All belonging to the Taxodiaceae family, they have in common woody "knee" roots that project from the ground or water, allowing them to live in aquatic habitats.  The Bald Cypress seems to have feather-like compound leaves, but when examining in detail, they are in fact elongated small leaves arranged in two ranks along a branchlet.  In its scientific name, "Distichum" exactly means two rows.  The Bald Cypress is an imported species from North America.  It gives a fantastic view of yellow fall leaves.'

Evergreen with alternate, spirally arranged leaves, acute at both ends, the Buddhist pine has high ornamental values.  They used to exist in abundance at the east coast of the territory.  Yet superstition turned them into vastly profitable commercial goods.  With increasing illegally logging, they are now endangered species.  Also a dioecious plant, among the row of Buddhist Pines grown in New Asia College, some flowers in spring bear small globose fruits with a purplish fleshy receptacle.  The plantâ€™s form of a human figure gives it the common name of "Buddhist Pine".'

    'A large deciduous tree, it can grow up to a height of 40 meters.  The growth is slow and one tree can age more than a hundred years.  The drooping twigs form a broad canopy of a bell shape, making the plant an excellent pavement tree.  The timber is of high quality, hard and reddish, often used to make instruments and furniture.  Flowering in summer, the slightly fragranced bloom is arranged in raceme inflorescence.  Spherical fruits are like "sunnyside-up" fried eggs, dark brown in color, usually possessing one stone inside, also dark brown in color.  On CUHK campus, one Burmese Rosewood is located in front of University Health Centre on the eastern campus; a taller one can be found on the western campus near where the stele of "Chinese University of Hong Kong" lies.'
